In coding, if a variable should never change, we don't use var. We use final or const.

1. final (Set Once)
Use this for things that are calculated once and then locked.

Example: A Transaction ID from a bank. You don't know it until the transaction happens,
but once it happens, it never changes.

2. const (Set Forever/Compile Time)
Use this for things that are known before the app even runs.

Example: The value of Pi (3.14) or the text "Welcome" on your login screen.

The Difference:

final: "I will lock this value when the code runs."

const: "I am freezing this value right now, before the code even starts."

void main() {
  // A variable (Can change)
  var stock = 100;
  stock = 90; // Allowed

  // Final (Locks after running)
  final String dateToday = DateTime.now().toString(); 
  // dateToday = "Tomorrow"; // ERROR! You can't change a final variable.

  // Const (Hardcoded forever)
  const double pi = 3.14159;
  // pi = 3.14; // ERROR!
}
