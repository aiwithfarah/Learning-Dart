So far, we have been writing code like this: String name = "Farah";
This is called Explicit Typing. You are forcing the computer to know it is a String.
However, Dart is smart. It can guess the type based on the value you give it.
This is called Type Inference.


void main() {
  // Explicit (What we did before)
  String name = "Farah";

  // Inferred (The modern way)
  // Dart sees quotes "" and says "Aha! This is a String."
  var brand = "Spice Meve"; 
  
  // Dart sees a number and says "This is an int."
  var stock = 100;

  print(brand);
}


Why use var? It makes code cleaner. The official Dart style guide recommends using var for local variables where the type is obvious.

The Danger Zone: dynamic There is another keyword called dynamic.

var: Once Dart guesses it is a String, it stays a String forever. You can't change it to a number.

dynamic: It turns off the safety. You can change it from a String to a Number to a Boolean.


void main() {
  // 1. VAR (Safe)
  var price = 100; 
  // price = "Cheap"; // ERROR! Dart knows 'price' is a number.

  // 2. DYNAMIC (Unsafe - Avoid this unless necessary)
  dynamic wildVariable = 100;
  wildVariable = "Now I am text!"; // This is allowed.
  wildVariable = true; // Now I am a boolean!
  
  print(wildVariable);
}
