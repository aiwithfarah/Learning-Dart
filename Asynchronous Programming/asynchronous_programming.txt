Fetching data from the internet takes time (maybe 200ms, maybe 2 seconds).
If your code runs like a normal train (line by line), the entire app would freeze while waiting for the data. 
The user couldn't scroll or click anything.
The Solution: Future and await Dart uses a tool called a Future to handle things that finish later.It represents a value that doesn't exist yet but will arrive later.
It's like a receipt at a coffee shop. You order (start the task), hold the receipt (the Future),
and wait until they call your name (the data arrives).

Syntax:

Future<Type>: This function returns a "receipt", not the data itself immediately.

async: Tells Dart "This function has slow parts." | Hey, this function might take a while. Don't freeze the app."


await: Tells Dart "Pause HERE and wait for the data before moving to the next line."
