Dart is a "Type Safe" language, meaning it checks your code for mismatched shapes (types) before you even run it.

? NULLABLE TYPE (The "Might Be Null" Label): Allows a variable to hold a null value.
int? age; //it's ok if this is empty

?? NULL COALESCING OPERATOR If the value is null, use a backup value instead.
//If user Age is null use 18
int finalAge = userAge ?? 18;

! NULL ASSERTION OPERATOR Forces Dart to treat a nullable value as if it's guaranteed to be there.
int realAge = userAge!

--------------------
The consequence of Safety
String? profileUrl; //currently null

// ERROR: Property 'length' cannot be accessed on 'String?' 
// because it is potentially null.
print(profileUrl.length)

//Dart stops you here. It is saying: "I can't give you the length of null.

//If I let you run this, your app will crash."
